# 2048 Game

2048 is a popular sliding block puzzle game. This Python implementation uses tkinter for the GUI and includes a simple AI using the minimax algorithm for computer play.

## How to Play

- Use arrow keys to move tiles in the desired direction.
- Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.
- The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install tkinter if not already available (`pip install tk`).

## Running the Game

Run `python game.py` to start the game.

## AI (Computer Play)

The game includes a basic AI that uses the minimax algorithm to make decisions on the computer's moves.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a graphical user interface for better user experience.
- Add animations for tile movements.
- Optimize AI for faster decision-making.
